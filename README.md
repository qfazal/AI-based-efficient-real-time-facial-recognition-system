# AI-based Efficient Real-Time Facial Recognition System

This project implements a real-time facial recognition system using **Facenet-PyTorch**, designed for efficiency and accuracy. The project commenced in February 2025 and is ongoing. The following tasks have been completed so far:



\- ✅ Literature review and identification of limitations and research gap  

\- ✅ Implementation of baseline model(script: `src/face_recognition.py`)  

\- ✅ Multiple faces in stored videos detected correctly using mtcnn 

\- ✅ Data of detected faces stored in a database file using pickle

\- ✅ Fast and reliable face recognition of known faces in terms of speed



\- ⚠️ Current accuracy has limitations; recognition performance decreases under certain conditions (e.g., low light, occlusion).



Tasks currently in progress:  

\- ⏳ Development and implementation of statistical adaptive thresholds for improved similarity matching and recognition

\- ⏳ Custom Webcam feed-based dataset creation and expansion

\- ⏳ Accuracy benchmarking  



Planned next steps:  

\- 🔜 Implement and test the pipeline in real-time using a webcam feed

\- 🔜 Extended evaluation metrics and benchmarking  

\- 🔜 Documentation and publishing of results
